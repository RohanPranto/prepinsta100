Implement a C++ program to find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an m x n grid. Use two different approaches:

Requirements:
For both approaches, use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
The program should accept m and n as input parameters and print the number of unique paths.
Test your program with the following example values:
m = 3 and n = 7

Example Output:
For the given input values, the program should output:
Number of unique paths from top-left to bottom-right is: 28
