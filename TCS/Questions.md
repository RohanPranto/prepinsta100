1.	Loops in Python
    ‚û°Ô∏èLoops in Python are control flow structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two main types of loops in Python:

    üçëFOR LOOP
    - Used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or any iterable object.
    - Syntax: 
        for item in iterable:
            # Code block to be executed
    - Example:
        for i in range(5):
            print(i)
    - This will print numbers from 0 to 4.

    üçëWhile Loop
    - Continues executing a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    - Syntax:
        while condition:
            # Code block to be executed
    - Example:
        count = 0
        while count < 5:
            print(count)
            count += 1
    - This will print numbers from 0 to 4.

2.	Revoke and Grant in DBMS
    ‚û°Ô∏èThe GRANT command is used to give specific privileges or permissions to database users or roles.
    -Syntax:
    GRANT privileges ON object TO user;
    -Example:
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO user1;
    -This grants the SELECT and INSERT privileges on the "employees" table to the user named "user1".

    The REVOKE command is used to take away previously granted privileges or permissions from database users or roles.
    -Syntax:
    REVOKE privileges ON object FROM user;
    -Example:
    REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user1;
    -This revokes the SELECT privilege on the "employees" table from the user named "user1".

3.	How to Assign an Array in Python
    ‚û°Ô∏èIn Python, you can assign values to an array using list literals or by creating an array object from the array module. Here's how to do it using list literals:
    -Example:
    my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**TCS Digital Questions**
1.	Where is the Synchronization Keyword Used?
    ‚û°Ô∏èIn multithreading or parallel programming, multiple threads or processes often access shared resources like variables, data structures, or files concurrently. Without proper synchronization mechanisms, this can lead to race conditions, where the outcome of the program becomes dependent on the timing or interleaving of thread execution, potentially causing unpredictable behavior or data corruption.

    Synchronization keywords or constructs provide a way to coordinate the execution of threads or processes to ensure orderly access to shared resources. They typically involve acquiring locks, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives to enforce mutual exclusion or coordination among threads.

    For example, in Java, the "synchronized" keyword can be used to mark methods or blocks of code, ensuring that only one thread can execute them at a time, thus preventing concurrent access to shared data. In C#, the "lock" keyword is used similarly to synchronize access to critical sections of code. In C or C++, synchronization primitives like mutexes or semaphores are commonly used for achieving thread safety.

    By using synchronization constructs effectively, developers can write concurrent programs that are correct, reliable, and free from race conditions or data corruption issues.

2.	What are Tuples in Python?
    ‚û°Ô∏èIn Python, tuples are immutable sequences, similar to lists, but with one key difference: once created, tuples cannot be modified. They are defined by enclosing comma-separated values within parentheses `()`.

    Here's a simple example of a tuple:

    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')

    Tuples can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other tuples or lists.

    You can access elements of a tuple using indexing, just like with lists:

    print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
    print(my_tuple[3])  # Output: 'a'

    Tuples are commonly used for representing fixed collections of items, such as coordinates, database records, or function arguments. They're also often returned by functions to represent multiple values.

    One of the main advantages of tuples over lists is that they are immutable, meaning you can't change the values once they are set. This immutability makes tuples suitable for situations where you want to ensure data integrity or when dealing with data that shouldn't be modified accidentally.

3.	Why Do We Use SQL?
    ‚û°Ô∏èSQL is widely used for:
    Retrieving and manipulating data in databases.
    Defining database structure and relationships.
    Enforcing data integrity and security.
    Analyzing and generating reports from data.
    Offering scalability and standardization across different database systems.

6.	Tree and B+ Tree
    ‚û°Ô∏èA tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
    It consists of a root node, which is the topmost node, and zero or more child nodes connected to it.
    Each node may have zero or more child nodes, forming a tree-like structure.
    Trees are commonly used for organizing hierarchical data, such as directory structures, family trees, and organization charts.
    In computer science, various types of trees are used, including binary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and more.
    
    B+ tree is a balanced tree data structure optimized for storing and retrieving large amounts of data efficiently.
    It is similar to a binary search tree but with additional properties that make it suitable for disk-based storage and indexing in databases and file systems.
    In a B+ tree, each node typically contains multiple keys and pointers to child nodes.
    Keys are stored in sorted order within each node, allowing for efficient search and retrieval operations.
    B+ trees maintain balance by ensuring that all leaf nodes are at the same level, which helps in maintaining consistent performance for various operations.
    B+ trees are commonly used for implementing database indexes, where they enable fast access to data based on indexed columns.
